Sentiment Analysis of reviews left on products on Amazon

This project is using TextBlob to analyse the sentiment of textual reviews left on products on Amazon, to then predict what review rating would be expected based on that sentiment, and compare that to the actual review rating left alongside the textual review.

To install this, just run the .py file alongside a dataset of Amazon reviews found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
